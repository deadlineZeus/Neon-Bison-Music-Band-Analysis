# Neon Bison Music Band Analysis

A comprehensive PostgreSQL-based analytics project for **Neon Bison**, a fictional American music band. Using real-world music store data, this project uncovers patterns in customer behavior, genre popularity, geographic spending, and revenue optimization ‚Äî aimed at guiding the band‚Äôs next concert tour planning. This is a completely stand-alone project created for the purpose of demonstrating skills to solve business problems and acquire technical mastery.

<summary><strong>Project Overview</strong></summary>

This project simulates a business intelligence case for a band preparing to scale up its operations globally. Using SQL queries in PostgreSQL, we analyze historical digital music store data to derive insights across dimensions like customer behavior, sales geography, media preferences, genre trends, and revenue contributions by artists.

The findings can inform setlist decisions, marketing geography, pricing strategies, and tour planning. To make informed decisions, they are analyzing past music store data to uncover:

- Who their top customers are  
- Which cities or countries have the highest engagement  
- Which genres and artists are most popular  
- What revenue patterns exist across markets and media  

All queries are written in PostgreSQL.

<summary><strong>Data Loading</strong></summary>

This section demonstrates how the dataset was imported and loaded to PostgreSQL database locally before our analysis. First a database was created and then we used automation for uploading the `.CSV` files using `Python` on the `Jupyter Notebook`. We used the `SQLAlchemy` library to import the functions to have the files path and do the task for us.
However, it is difficult to visually show how we achieved that in this `README.md` file, but you can take a quick look of that code running by clicking this.
