- Countries and cities with the highest music-related revenue  
- Top-spending customers and their geographic concentration  
- Regional dominance of music genres, especially Rock  
- Commercial performance of artists and albums by market  
- Customer behavior insights across genre and format preferences

<summary><strong>Data Loading</strong></summary>

This section demonstrates how the dataset was imported and loaded to `PostgreSQL` database locally before our analysis. First a database was created and then we used automation for uploading the .CSV files using `Python` on the `Jupyter Notebook`. We used the `SQLAlchemy` library to import the functions to have the files path and do the task for us.  

You can preview the automation steps in action here:
